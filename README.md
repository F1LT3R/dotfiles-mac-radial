# Dot Files


## VIM Shortcuts

### Multiple Cursors

Ctrl-n  - select words
Ctrl-n  - again to select next same word
Ctrl+p  - undo the last select
Ctrl+x  - skip the next same word
v       - back into regular mode

## Paste in insert mode

While in insert mode hit CTRL-R {register}. For example, CTRL-R * will insert in the contents of the clipboard and CTRL-R " (the unnamed register) inserts the the last delete or yank.

To find this in vim's help type :h i_ctrl-r
