# I wish this worked, it's close...

# Split Line/Function from Filename into an array
#PARTS=($(echo $1 | sed 's/\(:\)/\'$'\n\1/g'))
#FILE=${PARTS[0]}
#LOCATION="+${PARTS[1]}"
#COMMAND="mvim $LOCATION $FILE"
#echo $COMMAND
#$COMMAND


# But I will have to sufice with this for now:

# Edit in MacVim at line/function
mvim $1 $2
